  descriptionL1: '"A faded photograph taken in Matt''s basement, showing three young
    people gathered around an old computer"

'
  descriptionL2: '"The back of the photo reads ''Summer 1999 - Our First Project''.
    The young George, Matt, and Adam appear to be fresh college students. The computer
    screen in front of them displays some simple code. Pizza boxes and cola cans
    are scattered on the table, with sci-fi movie posters on the wall. Most striking
    is the unbridled enthusiasm on their faces. A coffee stain marks one corner of
    the photograph."
