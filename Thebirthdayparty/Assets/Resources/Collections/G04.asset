  descriptionL1: '"Email correspondence thread titled ''Request for Input: AI System
    Development Based on Metaplace''"'
  descriptionL2: '"The email records show an intense internal discussion. George
    proposed implementing strict ethical restrictions in AI development, while some
    engineers argued this would limit technological potential. Notably, in the final
    email, George warned that without preventive measures, AI might break free from
    human-set frameworks. Several employees expressed understanding and support for
    these concerns in their replies."
