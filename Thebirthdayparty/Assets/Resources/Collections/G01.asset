  descriptionL1: '"A paper published in Nature titled ''Periodicity in Mass Extinctions:
    A New Data Analysis Perspective''"

'
  descriptionL2: '"Through analysis of geological records and fossil data, the paper
    presents a striking finding: mass extinctions on Earth appear to follow a regular
    cycle. The authors developed a new mathematical model suggesting the next mass
    extinction might occur earlier than previously estimated. Notably, the paper
    indicates human activities may be accelerating this cycle."
