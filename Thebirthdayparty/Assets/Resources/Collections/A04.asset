  descriptionL1: '"An unpublished academic paper titled ''Mass Extinction: New Evidence
    for the Viral Hypothesis''"

'
  descriptionL2: '"This paper presents a bold hypothesis: dinosaur extinction might
    have been caused by a super-virus capable of cross-species transmission. Through
    analysis of anomalous fragments in fossil DNA, the author discovered traces of
    an unprecedented virus. The paper details the virus''s probable characteristics:
    its ability to spread rapidly between species and cause neurological system collapse
    in hosts. Notably, the author suggests in the conclusion that similar viral mechanisms
    might still exist in modern ecosystems."
