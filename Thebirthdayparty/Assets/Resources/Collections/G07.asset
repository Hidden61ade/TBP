  descriptionL1: '"A well-maintained 1980s personal computer, an Apple II model,
    with several yellowed manuscripts beside it"

'
  descriptionL2: '"The computer appears regularly maintained, with well-preserved
    keyboard and monitor. The manuscripts contain early programming code, with ''First
    Step into Digital World - 1985'' scribbled in the margins. A note attached to
    the monitor reads ''Never forget where we started.'' The age of the paper and
    ink suggests these items are genuinely from that era."
