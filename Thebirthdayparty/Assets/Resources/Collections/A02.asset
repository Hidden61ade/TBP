  descriptionL1: '"An online news article titled ''Internal Discord at Metaplace:
    Where Will the Founding Team Go?''"'
  descriptionL2: '"The article soberly describes the ideological conflicts between
    the three founders. Citing multiple anonymous insiders, it points to divergent
    visions for the project''s future: Adam pushing for expanded commercialization,
    George emphasizing strict technological boundaries, and Matt oscillating between
    these viewpoints. It specifically mentions a crucial board meeting that lasted
    into the night without reaching consensus. The article concludes with a quote
    from a senior tech analyst: ''This isn''t merely a business decision dispute,
    but a fundamental controversy about tech ethics.''"
