  content:
  - 'An encrypted electronic document titled "Project_T_Initial_Plan.pdf"'
  - This proposal extensively details the technical framework of Project tErminaL, 
    divided into sections on quantum computing architecture and consciousness transfer.
  - It specifically mentions a core module codenamed "Bridge", with a staggering budget 
    approved by Adam\u2019s signature.
  - While the document\u2019s structure remains intact, its content becomes elusive. 
    The specifications now contain numerous cautionary notes from different timepoints.
  - Some paragraphs have transformed into encrypted code, revealing disturbing simulation 
    results when decrypted.
  - The original project timeline now shows multiple branches, each leading to different 
    outcomes.
  - The document appears to have gained consciousness. Each opening reveals a different 
    version, alternating between hope and apocalypse.
  - The final page continuously flashes a code that deciphers into a simple question: 
    "If you could start over, would you choose to know the truth?"
  - "Matt\u2019s annotations read like a conversation between versions of himself from 
    different timelines"
